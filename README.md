# Amazon_Vine_Analysis
## Overview:
The Amazon Vine program is a service that allows manufacturers and publishers to receive reviews for their products. Companies like SellBy pay a small fee to Amazon and provide products to Amazon Vine members, who are then required to publish a review.
In this project, I pick xx datasets and use PySpark to perform the ETL process to extract the dataset, transform the data, connect to an AWS RDS instance, and load the transformed data into PgAdmin. I will use PySpark, Pandas, or SQL to determine if there is any bias toward favorable reviews from Vine members in my dataset. Finally, I will write a summary of analysis for Jennifer to submit to the SellBy stakeholders.

The purpose of this analysis.
## Results:
There is a bulleted list that addresses the three questions for unpaid and paid program reviews
 Using bulleted lists and images of DataFrames as support, address the following questions:
 How many Vine reviews and non-Vine reviews were there?
 xxx reviews were from Amazon Vine members
 xxx reviews were not from Amazon Vine members
 
 How many Vine reviews were 5 stars? How many non-Vine reviews were 5 stars?
 There were xx 5 stars review from Amazon xx Vine members.
 There were xx 5 stars review from not Amazon xx Vine members.
 
 What percentage of Vine reviews were 5 stars? What percentage of non-Vine reviews were 5 stars?
 44% of review by Amazon Vine members were 5 stars
 44% of reviews by not Amazon Vine members were 5 stars.

## Summary:
The summary states whether or not there is bias, and the result support this statement
An additional analysis is  recommended to support the statement.
In your summary, state if there is any positivity bias for reviews in the Vine program. Use the results of your analysis to support your statement. Then, provide one additional analysis that you could do with the dataset to support your statement.
